            <b>TO USE THIS SOFTWARE:</b><br />
            <ol>
                <li>First, configure ProPresenter to enable the network settings which allows Presentation Bridge to access the data. You can use any port numbers you want, provided they are not already in use. The port for "Enable Network" is the port <i>Presentation Bridge</i> will use.<br />
                <img src="/images/propresenter.png" width="450"/>
                <br />
                Make note of this port, as you will need to enter it on the Bridge page in order to connect.<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li>Go to the Bridge page on the server running <i>Presentation Bridge</i>: http://127.0.0.1/bridge<br />
                It runs on Port 80 by default.<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enter in the IP address, port, control password, and library path of your ProPresenter machine.<br />
                    <i>The library path must be the full absolute path to your ProPresenter library, as accessed from that machine.</i><br />
                    Example: /Users/technician/Documents/ProPresenter6/<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click "Connect to ProPresenter". If you've connected successfully, the interface will begin downloading the ProPresenter data.<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select a Bridge from the Bridge Config box. If it requires a password, you will need to enter it.<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click "Connect to Bridge" to connect. If a Bridge is already in use, you will receive an error message.<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Clients can connect by going to your server IP address with these listeners:
                    <ul>
                        <li>/ - the default "text listener"</li>
                        <li>/image - the image listener</li>
                        <li>/stagedisplay - the stage display version that shows the current and next slides</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
